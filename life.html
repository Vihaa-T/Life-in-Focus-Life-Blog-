        <h2>Budgeting Basics for Financial Health</h2>
        <p>Start by listing your income sources and monthly expenses. Divide expenses into categories like food, 
            transportation, entertainment, and savings. This basic budget will help you track where your money is 
            going and ensure youâ€™re saving a portion each month.</p>

        <h2>Setting and Achieving Goals</h2>
        <p>Set both short-term and long-term goals. Short-term goals, like completing a course or learning a new 
            skill, give you quick wins and motivation. Long-term goals, such as career aspirations, require planning 
            and patience. Write down these goals and revisit them regularly to track your progress.</p>

        <h2>Making To-Do Lists to Stay on Track</h2>
        <p>A simple to-do list can be a powerful tool for staying organized. List tasks in order of priority and focus 
            on completing them one at a time. Breaking down bigger tasks into smaller steps makes them more 
            manageable and less overwhelming.</p>

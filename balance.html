        <h2>Setting Clear Boundaries</h2>
        <p>Creating a clear boundary between study time and hobby time is essential. For instance, try setting specific hours in your day when you will focus solely on studies, and keep a separate time slot dedicated to your hobbies. When it’s study time, put away any distractions and give your full attention to your work, knowing you’ll have time later for fun activities.</p>

By doing this, you’ll ensure that nothing important gets missed, and you’ll have a clear picture of when you can unwind.</p>
